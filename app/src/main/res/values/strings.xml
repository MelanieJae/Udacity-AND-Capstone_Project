                        <p><p>Hotels are a great option when it comes to choosing a venue for your post-ceremony reception. Not only can a
                        hotel accommodate groups both large and small, but there\'s ample parking and professional staff to oversee every last detail. Some hotels provide catering, while others
                        allow you to provide whatever you wish. Visiting a banquet manager today will inspire you to pre-plan a memorable reception for tomorrow. </p></p>

                    It really depends on the specific cemetery\'s policy and applicable state law.
                    You may be able to have your cremated remains buried on top of the casket of your spouse,
                    for example, or utilize the space next to him or her.
                    Some cemeteries allow for multiple containers of cremated remains to be interred
                    in a single grave space for an additional charge.             </div>

                    Absolutely.  Regardless of whether you choose burial or cremation, a
                    funeral or memorial service is a celebration of the life that has been lived.
                    It offers family and friends the opportunity to pay tribute to their loved one
                    as well as an opportunity to grieve in a supportive environment. You can have
                    a ceremony with the urn present if the cremation has already taken place, or
                    you can have a traditional funeral with visitation and viewing before the body
                    is cremated if you desire.             </div>

            <div id="faq-widget-accordion-item-w3-585" class="collapse faq-body" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="faq-widget-accordion-tab-w3-585">

                    No. There is great benefit in pre-planning your funeral, even if you do not
                    pay for it in advance, which is called "pre-funding." When you pre-plan,
                    you can still make your wishes known to your loved ones, alleviating them from
                    the burden of making tough decisions when the time comes. However, if you pay
                    for ("pre-fund") your pre-planned funeral in advance, you can lock in today\'s
                    prices for services and merchandise which may be more expensive in the future.
